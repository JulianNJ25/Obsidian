Functions and methods are sort of similar, however one of the main differences between them is that functions do not use the **dot '.'** operator.

All information used in functions is passed through arguments

**print()**
	Used to print messages to the console
		`print("Hello world")`

**input()**
	Takes input from the user, it always returns a string value
		`input("Please enter a number: ")` -> returns String even if number is written

**int()**
	Converts argument values into int values, only works with numeric values
		`string_variable = 4`
		`int(string_variable)` -> string_variable will be recognised as an int

**pow(num, exponent_value)**
	Power operations, takes as argument the number to power, and the exponent we want to use
		`pow(12, 3)` -> 12^3

**list()**
