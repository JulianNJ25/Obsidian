Function that prints an output to the console

By default print messages with a **newline** character

We can add **newlines** in any place by writing `\n` 

```python
print('hello \n this is a newline')
```

We can also add a special directive to NOW put a `\n` at the end
```python
#this will put a blank space instead of newline

print('hello this wont have a newline', end=' ')
```
