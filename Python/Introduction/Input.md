In order to get the input of a user we must call the [[input()]] function, and then store whatever value was for input into any [[Variables]] we would like to use

Structure wise is similar to printing into console, however we must assign a variable that stores the information we want 


```python
name = input('Type your name: ')
print("Hello! " + name)
```

The variable will save whatever the user wrote for input until they pressed Enter

Even though the value imputed might me directly printed into the console, when building real life projects outside the shell we must use print statements as required to show the output of the input function
