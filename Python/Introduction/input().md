Reads input from the console

Structure wise is similar to printing into console, however we must assign a variable that stores the information we want 

```python
authentication = input('Are you a minor? Dont lie: ')
print("I knew you lied! you are " + authentication)
```

Note: The input function only returns [[Strings]]
